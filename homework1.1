 Homework: Homework 1.1: Readahead scenarios

Initially, your system has the following properties:

    You're working with a system where your indexes and part of your working set fit in memory
    You're not constrained by write locks
    You are using an SSD
    Documents are typically sorted on one of several fields and order does not correspond to natural order, though often adjacent docs will be requested in the same query

You then change your system in the following ways, one at a time, before returning to your original state.

During which of the following changes should a higher readahead result in a larger performance increase than it would have for the initial system state?

Assume that any property of the system not mentioned in a particular choice is still in the state listed above.
You begin frequently accessing your data from capped collections, in the order in which it was written.
Your working set outgrows the available memory, so you are having to go to storage much more often.
You are now writing frequently, so that write locks become a constraint while reads have to wait.
You are now using a spinning disk, rather than an SSD.
